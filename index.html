                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into the realm of science represents a pivotal shift in the traditional methods of scientific discovery. For centuries, the systematic and logical exploration of the natural world has followed a consistent methodology. However, the emergence of AI and ML technologies promises a profound transformation in how fundamental scientific discoveries are made today. This joint effort is crucial for enhancing interdisciplinary dialogue, stimulating innovative problem-solving approaches, and ultimately, enriching the scientific communityâ€™s capacity to tackle some of the most pressing and intricate problems in modern science.</p>

               <!-- <p><em>How to design principles using falsifiable predictions of the properties of deep learning systems?</em></p> -->

                <p>Meanwhile, foundation models, trained on vast and diverse datasets, have significantly altered the landscape of computer vision and natural language processing by demonstrating robust adaptability across a multitude of tasks. These models, including prominent examples like GPT-3 for language and CLIP for image-text processing, have revolutionized their respective fields by providing a versatile, pre-trained base that can be fine-tuned for various applications. By leveraging the extensive knowledge encoded in foundation models, researchers are addressing critical challenges such as long-term planning and multi-modal reasoning, which are essential for complex real-world applications like robotics and dialogue systems.</p>

                <!-- <p><strong>actively design deep learning with theory</strong></p> -->

                <p>We see an opportunity to collaboratively pursue the integration of AI-for-Science and foundation models, which is emerging as a transformative force in scientific domains. Leveraging foundation models, trained on extensive datasets and capable of multimodal processing, offers a unique opportunity to solve scientific problems and serve as a robust base for further domain-specific adaptations. Thus, the synergy between AI-for-Science and foundation models is poised to radically improve how we model complex phenomena, making it an essential area of investment for future scientific advancements. In contrast with small-scale AI-for-science models or foundation models for traditional domains of computer vision or natural language processing, we see both opportunities and unique challenges in advancing and solving scientific problems through approaches of building and applying foundation models.</p>
