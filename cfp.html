            <h3>Submission policy</h3>
            <p>Submission Format (inherit from Neurips 2025): <a href="./todo.zip" target="_blank"><b>Latex Template</b></a>.</p>
            <p>Submission portal: <a href="https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2025/Workshop/FM4Science" target="_blank"><b>OpenReview</b></a>.</p>
            <p>Our submission policy is inherited from <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPapers" target="_blank">NeurIPS 2025</a>. All authors and submissions must adhere to the <a href="https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CodeOfConduct" target="_blank">NeurIPS code of conduct</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Submissions</b>: The main text of a submitted paper must be <b>at least four pages long and no more than nine pages</b>, including all figures and tables. Additional pages containing references don’t count as content pages. If your submission is accepted, you will be allowed an additional content page for the camera-ready version.
                <ul>
                    <li>The main text and references may be followed by technical appendices, for which there is no page limit.</li>
                    <li>The maximum file size for a full submission, which includes technical appendices, is 50MB.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Supplementary material</b>: While all technical appendices should be included as part of the main paper submission PDF, authors may submit up to 100MB of supplementary material, such as data, or source code in a ZIP format. Supplementary material should be material created by the authors that directly supports the submission content. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.
                <ul>
                    <li>We encourage authors to upload their code and data as part of their supplementary material in order to help reviewers assess the quality of the work. Check <a href="https://neurips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy" target="_blank">the policy</a> as well as code submission <a href="https://github.com/paperswithcode/releasing-research-code" target="_blank">guidelines and templates</a> for further details.</li>
                </ul></li>
                <li><b>Use of Large Language Models (LLMs)</b>: We welcome authors to use any tool that is suitable for preparing high-quality papers and research. However, we ask authors to keep in mind two important criteria. First, we expect papers to fully describe their methodology, and any tool that is important to that methodology, including the use of LLMs, should be described also. For example, authors should mention tools (including LLMs) that were used for data processing or filtering, visualization, facilitating or running experiments, and proving theorems. It may also be advisable to describe the use of LLMs in implementing the method (if this corresponds to an important, original, or non-standard component of the approach). Second, authors are responsible for the entire content of the paper, including all text and figures, so while authors are welcome to use any tool they wish for writing the paper, they must ensure that all text is correct and original.</li>
                <li><b>Double-blind reviewing</b>:  All submissions must be anonymized and may not contain any identifying information that may violate the double-blind reviewing policy.  This policy applies to any supplementary or linked material as well, including code.  If you are including links to any external material, it is your responsibility to guarantee anonymous browsing.  Please do not include acknowledgements at submission time. If you need to cite one of your own papers, you should do so with adequate anonymization to preserve double-blind reviewing.  For instance, write “In the previous work of Smith et al. [1]…” rather than “In our previous work [1]...”). If you need to cite one of your own papers that is in submission to NeurIPS and not available as a non-anonymous preprint, then include a copy of the cited anonymized submission in the supplementary material and write “Anonymous et al. [1] concurrently show...”). Any papers found to be violating this policy will be rejected.</li>
                <li><b>Abstract Submission</b>: There is a mandatory abstract submission deadline on <b>August 19, 2025 (AoE time)</b>, three days before full paper submissions are due. While it will be possible to edit the title and abstract until the full paper submission deadline, submissions with “placeholder” abstracts that are rewritten for the full submission risk being removed without consideration. This includes titles and abstracts that either provide little or no semantic information (e.g., "We provide a new semi-supervised learning method.") or describe a substantively different claimed contribution.  The author list cannot be changed after the abstract deadline. After that, authors may be reordered, but any additions or removals must be justified in writing and approved on a case-by-case basis by the program chairs only in exceptional circumstances. </li>
                <li><b>Anti-collusion</b>: NeurIPS does not tolerate any collusion whereby authors secretly cooperate with reviewers, ACs or SACs to obtain favorable reviews. </li>
                <li><b>Publication of accepted submissions</b>:  Reviews, meta-reviews, and any discussion with the authors will be made public for accepted papers (but reviewer, area chair, and senior area chair identities will remain anonymous). Camera-ready papers will be due in advance of the conference. All camera-ready papers must include a funding disclosure. We strongly encourage accompanying code and data to be submitted with accepted papers when appropriate, as per the code submission policy. Authors will be allowed to make minor changes for a short period of time after the conference.</li>
                <li>Posting papers on preprint servers like ArXiv is permitted.</li>
                <li>All submissions must represent original work and not previously published elsewhere.</li>
                <li>Submissions are only accepted in written English.</li>
                <li>All papers must be proofread by the authors before submission.</li>
                <li>This workshop is non-archival; even though all accepted papers will be available on OpenReview, there are no formally-published proceedings.</li>
            </ul>
